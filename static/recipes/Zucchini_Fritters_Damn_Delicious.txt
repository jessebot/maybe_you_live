Zucchini Fritters - Damn Delicious

ZUCCHINI FRITTERS
YIELD: 4 SERVINGS

PREP TIME: 15 MINUTES

COOK TIME: 10 MINUTES

TOTAL TIME: 25 MINUTES

These fritters are unbelievably easy to make, low calorie, and the perfect way to
sneak in some veggies!

INGREDIENTS:
• 1 1/2 pounds zucchini, grated
• 1 teaspoon salt
• 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
• 1/4 cup grated Parmesan
• 2 cloves garlic, minced
• 1 large egg, beaten
• Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
• 2 tablespoons olive oil

DIRECTIONS:
1. Place grated zucchini in a colander over the sink. Add salt and gently toss to combine; let sit for 10 minutes.
Using a clean dish towel or cheese cloth, drain zucchini completely.
2. In a large bowl, combine zucchini, flour, Parmesan, garlic and egg; season with salt and pepper, to taste.
3. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Scoop tablespoons of batter for each fritter, flattening
with a spatula, and cook until the underside is nicely golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook on the
other side, about 1-2 minutes longer.
4. Serve immediately.
