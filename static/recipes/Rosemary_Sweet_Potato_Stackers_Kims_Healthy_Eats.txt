Rosemary Sweet Potato Stackers | Kim's Healthy Eats

My original intent was to create a potato recipe to help with my portion control. Well that didn’t work,
I ended up eating three. I had to be certain the flavor was just right so I stepped up… Who am I
kidding I knew at the first bite they were divine
I have serious issues with potatoes…I just love
them!

When you made them a day ahead of time, did you bake them first then refrigerate them? Or just
prep them and bake them day of?
