Directions
For the chickpea crab cakes: Place the reserved chickpea liquid into a
large bowl, then add the cream of tartar and whip vigorously until
foamy and thick.
Whisk in the parsley, lemon juice, Old Bay and honey mustard, then
add the bread pieces and toss to coat. Let sit until the bread is soft,
about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, ﬁnely chop the chickpeas (alternatively, you can pinch or
smush them). When the bread mixture is ready, add the chickpeas
and toss and squeeze the mixture until it holds together. Form into
eight 3/4‑inch thick patties with nice rounded edges. Cover and chill
them for at least 1 hour.
For the tartar sauce: Whisk together the mayonnaise, honey mustard,
Old Bay, pickle and pickle brine in a small bowl. Refrigerate until
ready to serve.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Whisk a large pinch of salt into the
ﬂour and put on a plate. Pour enough oil to cover the bottom of a
large nonstick skillet and heat over medium‑high heat. Dredge half of
the cakes in the ﬂour. Once the oil is hot and shimmering, add the
cakes and cook until crunchy and deep golden brown, about 3
minutes per side. Adjust the heat as necessary to keep them from
browning too quickly. Transfer to a baking sheet and repeat with the
remaining cakes. Sprinkle each with salt, then bake until heated
completely through, about 5 minutes.
Serve the chickpea crab cakes with the tartar sauce and lemon
wedges.
