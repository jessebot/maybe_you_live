CRANBERRY PISTACHIO ENERGY BITES
Kick up your energy with these simple and healthy no-bake Cranberry Pistachio Energy Bites!
 PREP TIME: 15 MINS

 TOTAL TIME: 15 MINS

INGREDIENTS:
• 8 ounces (about 1 packed cup) chopped dates
• 1/2 cup honey
• 1 Tablespoon chia seeds (optional)
• 1 Tablespoon ground ﬂax seeds
• pinch of salt
• 1 1/2 cups old-fashioned oats (dry, not cooked)
• 1 cup shelled pistachio nuts
• 1 cup dried cranberries
• 1/3 cup white chocolate chips (optional)

DIRECTIONS:
Combine the dates, honey, chia seeds, ﬂax seeds and salt in a food processor, and pulse until smooth and combined. You
should be able to stir the mixture -- if it is too thick, add in another tablespoon or two of honey.
Transfer the mixture to a large bowl, and stir in the oats, pistachios, dried cranberries, and white chocolate chips until evenly
combined. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
Once the mixture is cool (and easier to work with), use a spoon or cookie scoop to shape it into your desired size of energy
balls. (Mine were about 1-inch in diameter.) Alternately, you can line a small baking pan with parchment paper, and press
the mixture evenly into the pan, let it cool, and then cut into bars.
Store covered in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. (Storing them in the refrigerator especially helps the energy bites hold
their shape.)
