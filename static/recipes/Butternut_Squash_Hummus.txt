Ingredients
HUMMUS
1 cup (140 g) cubed butternut squash
4 cloves garlic, skin on (12 g)
4 cloves garlic, peeled + minced (~2 Tbsp | 12 g)
1 lemon, juiced (2 Tbsp or 30 ml)
1 15-ounce (425 g) can chickpeas, lightly rinsed + drained
1/3 cup (80 g) tahini
3-4 Tbsp (45-60 ml) olive oil, plus more for roasting garlic
Sea salt + pepper to taste (~1/4 tsp each)
1/2 cup (30 g) fresh parsley, chopped
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp ground cumin
optional: 1/4 tsp smoked paprika
FOR SERVING optional
Whole Wheat Pita Chips
Roasted Carrots*

Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F and position a rack in the middle of the oven.
2. Add cubed butternut squash and 4 unpeeled garlic cloves to a baking sheet and drizzle with 1 Tbsp olive
oil and a pinch each salt and pepper. Toss to combine.
3. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until all squash is fork tender and the garlic is golden brown. Let cool 5
minutes.
4. Peel roasted garlic and add to food processor or blender, along with squash, 4 cloves fresh minced garlic,
lemon juice, chickpeas, tahini, olive oil, salt, pepper, parsley, cinnamon, cumin and smoked paprika
(optional).

5. Purée until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed and adding more olive oil or a touch of
water if it's too thick.
6. Taste and adjust seasonings, then serve immediately with pita chips and vegetables of choice (see notes
for roasted carrots). Alternatively, refrigerate until fully chilled - about 3-4 hours - for a thicker, creamier
dip.
7. Store leftovers, covered, in the refrigerator up to 4-5 days, though best when fresh.

Notes
*To roast carrots, preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Remove greens, peel, and slice any large carrots in half
lengthwise. Transfer to a baking sheet and lightly drizzle with olive or grape seed oil and a pinch each salt and
pepper. Toss to coat, then arrange in an even layer and bake for 20-30 minutes, or until golden brown and
tender.
