1 whole Zucchini
1 pinch Salt And Pepper
1 Tablespoon Olive Oil
2 whole Udi's Gluten Free Tortillas
â cups Sliced Red Onions
4 Tablespoons Hummus
2 whole Slices White Cheddar Or Chiptole Gouda
1 cup Kale, Tough Stems Removed
1 whole Tomato, Thinly Sliced

Preparation
Heat a skillet or grill to medium heat.
Remove the ends from the zucchini and discard them. Slice the remaining zucchini lengthwise
into strips. Toss sliced zucchini in olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Place sliced zucchini directly on the grill in a single layer and let it cook for 3 minutes then turn
them over and cook for 2 more minutes. Set zucchini aside.
Place the tortillas on the grill for approximately one minute, or just until grill marks are visible
and tortillas are pliable.
Remove tortillas from grill and assemble the wraps: 2 tablespoons of hummus, one slice of
cheese, some zucchini slices, 1/2 cup kale, and some onion and tomato slices on each. Wrap
tightly and enjoy immediately.
