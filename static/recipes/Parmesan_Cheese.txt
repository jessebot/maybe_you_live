Cuisine: Vegan, Gluten Free
Serves: ~1 cup

Ingredients
3/4 cup (90 g) raw cashews
3 Tbsp (9 g) nutritional yeast
3/4 tsp sea salt
1/4 tsp garlic powder

Instructions
1. Add all ingredients to a food processor and mix/pulse until a fine meal is achieved. Store in the
refrigerator to keep fresh. Lasts for several weeks.
2. I love vegan parmesan on top of chilaquiles, vegan pizza, breadsticks, pastas and gratins. It's also a great
addition to vegan meatballs and can be converted into mexican cheese 3 ways!

Notes
*This is not my original recipe, but one I learned from other vegan bloggers and have adapted for my own use!
