Recipe type: Entrée, Soup
Cuisine: Vegan, Gluten Free
Serves: 2-3

Ingredients
BROTH
1 Tbsp (15 ml) toasted or untoasted sesame oil*
1 small knob ginger, sliced lengthwise (into long strips)
5 cloves garlic, chopped
1 large onion, chopped lengthwise
2 1/2 Tbsp (40 g) yellow or green curry paste
4 cups (960 ml) vegetable broth
2 cups (480 ml) light coconut milk
optional: 1-2 Tbsp coconut sugar (more to taste)
optional: 1/2 tsp ground turmeric (for color and more curry flavor)
1 Tbsp (15 g) white or yellow miso paste
FOR SERVING
2-3 cups noodles of choice (i.e. spiralized zucchini squash, cooked ramen noodles*, or cooked brown rice
noodles)
optional: 2 portobello mushrooms, stems removed, sliced into 1/2-inch pieces (+ sautéed in 1 Tbsp sesame
oil + 1 Tbsp tamari + 1 tsp maple syrup)
optional: Fresh green onion, chopped
optional: Sriracha or chili garlic sauce

Instructions
1. Heat a large pot over medium-high heat. Once hot, add oil, garlic, ginger and onion. Sauté, stirring
occasionally for 5-8 minutes, or until the onion has developed a slight sear (browned edges).
2. Add curry paste and sauté for 1-2 minutes more, stirring frequently. Then add vegetable broth and
coconut milk and stir to deglaze the bottom of the pan.

Coconut Curry Ramen

3. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce heat to low and cover. Simmer on low for at least 1
hour, up to 2-3, stirring occasionally. The longer it cooks, the more the flavor will deepen and develop.
4. Taste broth and adjust seasonings as needed, adding coconut sugar for a little sweetness, turmeric for
more intense curry flavor, or more sesame oil for nuttiness.
5. About 10 minutes before serving, prepare any desired toppings/sides, such as noodles, sautéed portobello
mushrooms, or green onion (optional).
6. Just before serving, scoop out 1/2 cup of the broth and whisk in the miso paste. Once fully dissolved, add
back to the pot and turn off the heat. Stir to combine.
7. Either strain broth through a fine mesh strainer (discard onions and ginger or add back to the soup), or
ladle out the broth and leave the onions and mushrooms behind.
8. To serve, divide noodles of choice between 2-3 serving bowls. Top with broth and desired toppings. Serve
with chili garlic sauce or sriracha for added heat.
9. Best when fresh, though the broth can be stored (separate from sides/toppings) in the refrigerator for up
to 5 days, or in the freezer for up to 1 month.

Notes
*You can sub sesame oil for coconut, but the sesame adds a nice rich nutty flavor to the ramen that I prefer.
*Nutrition information is a rough estimate for 1 of 3 servings calculated using brown rice noodles and no
additional toppings.
*If using ramen noodles, this recipe would not be gluten free.
