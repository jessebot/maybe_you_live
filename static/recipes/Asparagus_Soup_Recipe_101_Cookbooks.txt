A Simple Asparagus Soup
2 tablespoons unsalted butter or extra-virgin coconut oil
1 small onion, chopped
1/2 pound new potatoes, tiny cubes
1 tablespoon green curry paste, or to taste (optional)
1 pound asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch segments
1 14-ounce can full-fat coconut milk
1 1/2 teaspoons sea salt, or to taste
1 1/4 cups of water, or to cover
1 lemon or lime
to serve (topping ideas): grated hard-boiled egg, herbs,
crumbled whole-grain crackers or croutons, crème fraiche
In a large soup pan over medium-high heat add the butter and onion. Stir until the
onion is well coated, and allow to sauté until translucent, a few minutes. Stir in the
potatoes, and cook until completely tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the curry paste,
and then the asparagus. Allow to cook another minute or two, and then add the
coconut milk, salt, and water, adding more water to cover if needed. Allow to simmer
until the asparagus is tender, 2-3 minutes, and then puree using a blender or hand
blender until the soup is completely silky smooth.
This next part is important (with any soup) - make any needed adjustments. Add
more water if the consistency needs to be thinned out a bit. After that taste for salt,
adding more if needed. I also like to season this soup with a great big squeeze or
lemon or lime juice. Serve topped with whatever you have on hand - I made it this
time around with grated hard-boiled egg, herbs, crackers, and a touch of crème
fraiche, but you could just sprinkle a few chopped peanuts on top and call it a day.
Serves 4.
