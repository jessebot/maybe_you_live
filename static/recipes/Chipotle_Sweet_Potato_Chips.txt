Ingredients
2 medium sweet potatoes
2 Tbsp olive oil
1/2 tsp sea salt
1 Tbsp chipotle pepper powder
2 Tbsp brown sugar

Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
2. Wash and scrub sweet potatoes. Then, thinly chop with a knife getting them as uniform as possible. The
thinner and more consistent they are the more evenly/quickly they’ll cook.
3. Place potato slices in a large bowl and toss with olive oil. Then add salt, chipotle and brown sugar and toss
again until well coated.
4. Transfer potatoes to two lightly greased baking sheets (or more) and arrange in a single layer.
5. Bake for 30-45 minutes, flipping once around the 20 minute mark. You’ll know they’re done when they’re
browned and crispy. Be careful not to burn as they turn pretty quickly.
6. Leave out to cool completely, even overnight. And do not bag until then, otherwise they can lose their
crisp.
