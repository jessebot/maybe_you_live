        <h3>Fighting Misconceptions</h3>
        <div class="card-actions">
          <p />
          A calorie is <i>not</i> a calorie
          <br /><small>Calories are an overall metric to measure nutritional intake, but where those calories come from is critical.</small>
          <p />
          Healthy eating is not expensive, or time consuming
          <br /><small>Donâ€™t let the $9 pile of iceberg lettuce at the deli, or convenience-based advertising mislead you...</small>
          <p />
          Sugary drinks, sweets, and fast food
          <br /><small>Yes, you have to give them up in order to make permanent, healthy changes.</small>
          <p />
          Fad diets are not inherently healthy
          <br /><small>Fad diets are marketed as being easy to adopt, and lifestyle convenient, but often don't promote long term health habit changes. They encourage yo-yo dieting.</small>
          <p />
          "I don't do breakfast"
          <br /><small>What most people consider "breakfast" is not healthy in any way. Redefine what "breakfast" is for you, and try it again. Depending on lifestyle, the body benefits greatly from having a balance of nutrients shortly after waking up. This affects both energy levels, and appetite throughout the day. A sugary breakfast will make you feel full for a brief period, give you a brief burst of energy, then make you hungry shortly after, whereas a nutrient balanced breakfast will give you sustained energy, and keep you feeling more full for longer.</small>
          <p />
          No one is perfect
          <br /><small>Failure is part of learning how to improve. Good times make for good habits, but bad times make for good lessons.</small>
