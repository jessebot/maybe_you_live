Recipe type: Entree, Side Dish
Cuisine: Vegan, Gluten Free
Serves: 2 as entree, 4 as side

Ingredients
3 1/2 - 4 cups (840-960 ml) vegetable broth, warmed on the stovetop
2 Tbsp (30 ml) olive oil, divided
8 ounces (227 g) bella or crimini mushrooms (sub up to half with shiitake), brushed clean, sliced
Sea salt + black pepper to taste
3/4 cup (960 ml) thinly sliced leeks, well rinsed and dried* (or sub shallot)
1 cup (185 g) arborio rice
1/4 cup (60 ml) dry white wine (or sub more vegetable broth)
optional: 1 Tbsp (14 g) vegan butter
1/4 cup (20 g) vegan parmesan cheese, plus more for serving
optional: Fresh chopped parsley to garnish

Instructions
1. In a small saucepan, heat vegetable broth over medium heat. Once simmering, reduce heat to low to keep
warm.
2. In the meantime, heat a large saucepan over medium heat. Once hot, add 1 Tbsp olive oil and mushrooms.
Season with a pinch each salt and pepper and sauté until tender and slightly browned - 3-4 minutes stirring frequently. Remove from pan and set aside in a small dish.
3. Heat the same large saucepan over medium heat once more. Once hot, add 1 Tbsp olive oil and leeks.
Sauté for 1-2 minutes, or until softened and very slightly browned.
4. Add arborio rice, and cook for 1 minute, stirring occasionally to coat.
5. Add dry white wine and stir gently. Cook for 1-2 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed.
6. Using a ladle, add warmed vegetable stock 1/2 cup (120 ml) at a time, stirring almost constantly, giving
the risotto little breaks to come back to a simmer. The heat should be medium, and there should always be
a slight simmer. You want the mixture to be cooking but not boiling, or it will get gummy and cook too
fast.

7. Continue to add vegetable stock, stirring to incorporate, until the rice is 'al dente' - cooked through but
still has a slight bite. This whole process should only take 15-20 minutes.
8. Once the rice is cooked through and al dente, remove from heat and add vegan butter (optional), vegan
parmesan cheese, and most of the cooked mushrooms from earlier, reserving a few for serving. Stir to
coat.
9. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding a pinch of salt and pepper to taste, or more vegan parmesan to
enhance the cheesiness.
10. To serve, divide between serving bowls and top with remaining mushrooms, additional vegan parmesan
cheese, and a sprinkle of parsley (optional).
11. Best when fresh, though leftovers will keep covered in the refrigerator for 2-3 days.
