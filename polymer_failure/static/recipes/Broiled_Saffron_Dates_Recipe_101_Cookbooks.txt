Broiled Saffron Dates
Tip: If you don't have almond extract on hand, you can certainly use another
alcohol­based extract ­ vanilla, rose or orange blossom, etc. Saffron is alcohol
soluble, and you get great extraction with a quick splash/soak.
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1 pinch saffron
1 1/2 tablespoons melted ghee or clarified butter, or extra-virgin olive
oil
1 pinch flaky sea salt or(!) smoked sea salt
12 dates
Heat the oven to 350F / 175C, with a rack placed in the top third.
In a tiny bowl, pour the almond extract over the saffron. Jostle or stir
until the saffron releases its color. Let sit a minute or so. Stir the
saffron mixture into the ghee / olive oil.
Place the dates in an ovenproof baking dish. Pour the saffron mixture
over the dates and toss to coat. Arrange the dates in a single layer,
sprinkle with a bit of salt, and place in the oven. Let cook for 5 minutes
or so, long enough that the dates heat through. At this point switch to
the broiler - broil just until the tops of the dates darken a bit, not long
at all. Serve warm. If you transfer the dates to a separate serving dish
be sure to re-drizzle with the saffron oil - it's the good stuff!
Makes 12 dates.
