Falafel that can rival any restaurant, although it remains vegan,
gluten free and pan-cooked, not fried.
Author: Minimalist Baker
Recipe type: Entree
Cuisine: Mediterranean

Ingredients
4 cups stemmed and torn collard greens (one bunch), or swiss chard
1 15.5 ounce can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
3 medium to large cloves garlic, chopped
1.5 Tbsp tahini
1.5 Tbsp fresh lemon juice
1/4 tsp cumin
sea salt and black pepper
3-4 Tbsp oat flour (ground from gluten free oats)
~ 4 Tbsp grapeseed or olive oil for cooking

Instructions
1. Add collard greens, chickpeas, garlic, tahini, lemon juice, cumin, and a healthy pinch each salt and pepper
to a food processor and mix to combine (see photo).
2. Once well incorporated, transfer to a mixing bowl and stir in oat flour 1 Tbsp at a time until the mixture is
thick enough to handle – about 3-4 Tbsp.
3. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. I added more salt, pepper and lemon juice, and a touch more
tahini.
4. Heat a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat and add 2 Tbsp oil at a time. Swirl to coat pan.
5. Add 4 falafel (or however many will fit very comfortably) to the pan at a time.
6. Check at the 1-2 minute mark to ensure they’re not browning too quickly. If they are, slightly reduce heat.
Flip once deep golden brown – about 3-4 minutes.
7. Cook until the underside is golden brown as well.
8. Serve immediately with hummus and paprika, or inside a pita with garlic sauce or hummus.
9. Will store in the fridge, layered with parchment paper in an airtight container, for several days. Freeze to
keep longer.
