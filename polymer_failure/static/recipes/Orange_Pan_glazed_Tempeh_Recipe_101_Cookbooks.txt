Orange Pan-glazed Tempeh Recipe
HS note: This recipe is equally good made with tofu. I made a couple minor tweaks
to the recipe based on American ingredients/measurements. You can make a meal
out of this by pairing it with some lightly sauteed seasonal vegetables, or in this
case I simple served if over some left­over cooked wheat berries that I heated with
a bit of chopped kale.
1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice (3-4 large juicy oranges)
1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger
2 teaspoons tamari (or soy sauce)
1 1/2 tablespoons mirin
2 teaspoons maple syrup
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
2 small garlic cloves, crushed
roughly 10 ounces of tempeh (or extra-firm tofu)
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 lime
a handful of cilantro (coriander) leaves
Put the orange juice in a small bowl. Squeeze the grated ginger over the bowl to
extract the juices, then discard the pulp. Add the tamari, mirin, and maple syrup,
ground coriander, and garlic. Mix together and set aside.
Cut the tempeh (or tofu) into thin-ish, bite-sized pieces, and if working with tofu, pat
dry with a paper towel.
Put the olive oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot but
not smoking, add the tempeh and fry for 5 minutes, or until golden underneath.
Turn and cook the other side for another 5 minutes, or until golden. Pour the orange
juice mixture into the pan and simmer for 10 minutes, or until the sauce has reduced
to a lovely thick glaze. Turn the tempeh once more during this time and spoon the
sauce over the tofu from time to time.
Serve the tempeh drizzled with any remaining sauce and a squeeze of lime, with the
coriander scattered on top. Heidi note: As I mention in the head notes, I served this
over some leftover wheat berries heated with a few handfuls of chopped kale.
Serves 4. (or two if you love it as much as we did ­h)
