A step-by-step tutorial of how to make a flax egg, egg substitute
for baking!
Author: Minimalist Baker
Recipe type: Vegan
Cuisine: Vegan, Baking
Serves: 1

Ingredients
1 Tbsp (7 g) flaxseed meal (ground raw flaxseed)
2 1/2 Tbsp (37 ml) water

Instructions
1. Add flaxseed meal and water to a dish and stir. Let rest for 5 minutes to thicken. Add to recipes in place of
1 egg.
2. It's not an exact 1:1 substitution in every recipe because it doesn't bind and stiffen during baking quite
like an egg does. But I've found it to work incredibly well in pancakes, quick breads, brownies, muffins,
cookies, and many other recipes.

Notes
*This is not my original recipe, but one I discovered on many vegan baking blogs and have since adapted for
my own use.
