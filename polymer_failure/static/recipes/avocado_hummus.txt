Avocado Hummus
Ingredients
1 (15 oz) can chick peas, well drained
2 medium ripe avocados, cored and peeled (13 oz before cored and peeled)

1 1/2 Tbsp tahini
3 Tbsp fresh lime juice
1 clove garlic, peeled
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
1/8 tsp cumin

Red pepper ﬂakes, for topping

Directions
Pulse chick peas, olive oil, tahini, lime juice, and garlic in a food processor until smooth, about
2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste (I did a scant 1/2 tsp salt and about 1/8 tsp
pepper), add cumin and avocados and pulse mixture until smooth and creamy, about 1 - 2
minutes longer.
Serve topped with more olive oil if desired and sprinkle with cilantro and red pepper ﬂakes.
