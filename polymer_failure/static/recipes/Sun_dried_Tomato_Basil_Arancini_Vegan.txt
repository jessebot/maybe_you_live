10-ingredient vegan arancini with cauliflower rice, sun-dried
tomatoes, and basil. Inspired by an Italian dish that's typically
cooked rice stuffed with cheese and fried, only my version is
healthier and veganized!

Cuisine: Vegan, Italian
Serves: 14 arancini

Ingredients
ARANCINI
3 cups cauliflower rice (~ 1 small head cauliflower)
4 cloves garlic, minced (2 Tbsp, 12 g)
2 Tbsp (30 ml) olive oil, divided plus more for sautéing
1 flax egg (1 Tbsp (7 g) flaxseed meal + 2.5 Tbsp (37 ml) water)
1/2 cup (55 g) sun-dried tomatoes, chopped
3 Tbsp (10 g) fresh basil, chopped (or 1 Tbsp dried basil), plus more for serving
2 tsp dried oregano
1/2 cup (40 g) vegan parmesan cheese
1/2 cup (34 g) panko bread crumbs
1/4 tsp each sea salt and black pepper, plus more to taste
COATING
3 Tbsp (13 g) panko bread crumbs
1 Tbsp (5 g) vegan parmesan cheese
FOR SERVING optional
1 cup (256 g) favorite marinara sauce

Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F and line a baking sheet with foil.
2. In a large skillet over medium heat, sauté cauliflower rice and garlic in 1 Tbsp olive oil for 5 minutes, with
a lid on, stirring frequently. Set aside.
3. Add flax egg to blender or food processor. Wait 5 minutes.

4. Add sun-dried tomatoes, basil, oregano, vegan parmesan cheese, and panko bread crumbs, and pulse/mix
to combine.
5. Add cauliflower rice to food processor or blender, along with salt and pepper and remaining 1 Tbsp olive
oil. Pulse/mix a few more times and then transfer to a mixing bowl to avoid getting the mixture too pastelike.
6. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Add more bread crumbs and/or vegan parmesan cheese if the
mixture feels too wet. It should be moldable when squeezed together.
7. Transfer mixture to refrigerator to chill for 30 minutes, or freezer for 15 minutes. At this time, mix
together panko bread crumbs and vegan parmesan cheese in a shallow bowl. Set aside.
8. Once chilled, use a Tablespoon or cookie scoop (I like this one from Amazon) to scoop out rounded
Tablespoon amounts of the arancini mixture.
9. Carefully form into balls by resting the arancini in your palm and using your other hand's fingers to
gently roll until a ball is formed. They are fragile, so work carefully. There should be 13-14 total.
10. Coat arancini one at a time in the panko-vegan parmesan mixture, then set aside on a baking sheet.
11. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add 1-2 Tbsp oil and brown 6-7 arancini at a time for 4-5
minutes total, rolling with a spoon or fork to brown on all sides. Turn down heat if browning too quickly.
12. Once all are browned, place back on a baking sheet and bake in a 375 degree F for 15-20 minutes. In the
meantime, prepare/heat sauce (optional) and any other desired toppings or sides.
13. Let arancini cool for 5 minutes, then serve with marinara and additional vegan parmesan cheese. These
are best eaten with a fork as they are tender.
14. Leftovers keep for 2-3 days in the refrigerator, though best when fresh. Reheat in the microwave or in a
375 F degree oven until warmed through.

Notes
*Inspired by Saveur.
*Nutrition information is a rough estimate for 1 of 14 arancini without additional sauce.
