Serves: 6

Ingredients
BATTER
3/4 cup (120 g) brown rice flour or chickpea flour*
Healthy pinch sea salt
1/2 tsp curry powder
2 tsp tandoori masala spice (see notes for DIY blend + where to buy)
1/2 cup (120 ml) unsweetened plain almond or rice milk
6-8 Tbsp (90-120 ml) water
CAULIFLOWER
1 head cauliflower, large stalks removed, cut/torn into bite-size pieces
SAUCE
1/4 cup (80 g) red curry paste (ensure vegan friendly - Thai True + Thai Kitchen are best)
2 tsp melted coconut oil
2-3 tsp maple syrup (to taste)
Water to thin (2-3 Tbsp or 30-45 ml)
FOR SERVING
Green Chutney

Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 450 F (232 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper (important or the wings will
stick).
2. Next, prepare batter. Mix dry ingredients together, and then add almond milk and 6 Tbsp water to start.
Stir with a whisk or fork until well combined. You want the batter thick but pourable so it can adhere to

the cauliflower - too runny and it won't stick. Add only enough water until you reach the right
consistency. Add more brown rice flour if it becomes too thin.
3. Once the oven is preheated, add the cauliflower to the batter to coat. Shake off excess and place on baking
sheet. Give each piece 1 inch of room to prevent sogginess. Depending on the size of your cauliflower this
may require cooking on two baking sheets or in two batches.
4. Bake for 25 minutes. In the meantime prepare the sauce by whisking together curry paste, coconut oil,
and maple syrup. Add just a bit of water to thin so it resembles a glaze consistency.
5. Once the cauliflower has finished baking, remove from oven and dip/toss in the glaze 1-2 pieces at a time.
Shake off excess, then place back on baking sheet and bake for another 20-25 minutes, or until browned
on the edges and the glaze has caramelized.
6. While baking, prepare chutney (optional), by adding all ingredients to a blender and blending until
creamy and smooth. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more garlic for zing, salt for saltiness,
maple syrup for sweetness, or water to thin.
7. Let cauliflower cool slightly and then serve immediately. Best when fresh. The wings can be frozen (either
at the glazed stage or the glazed and baked stage) and then reheated in a 350 degree F (176 C) oven until
warmed through.

Notes
* I buy my Tandoori Masala blend at Whole Foods. However, you can also make your own DIY Tandoori Masala
Blend: 3 Tbsp ground cumin, 2 Tbsp garlic powder, 2 Tbsp smoked paprika, 3 tsp ground ginger, 2 tsp ground
coriander, 2 tsp ground cardamom. Multiply as needed.
*I tested this recipe with both chickpea and brown rice flour and both worked! But I will say the overall texture
was better with brown rice flour. If not gluten free you can use unbleached all-purpose flour.
*Method adapted from the talented pair at Hot For Food.
