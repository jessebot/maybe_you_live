Serves: 4

Ingredients
SWEET POTATOES
3 large, organic sweet potatoes, sliced into thick wedges (skin on)
2 Tbsp avocado or melted coconut oil (any neutral oil with a high smoke point)
1/2 tsp sea salt + pinch black pepper
“HONEY” MUSTARD SAUCE
2 tbsp creamy salted cashew butter (or sub tahini, although I much preferred the cashew butter for a
more neutral flavor)
1 Tbsp spicy mustard
2 Tbsp maple syrup (or sub agave or honey if not vegan)
pinch each salt and pepper
1-2 Tbsp unsweetened original almond milk

Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees and grease a baking sheet.
2. Toss sweet potatoes in oil until all sides are well coated. Season with salt and pepper and toss once more,
then arrange in a single layer on the baking sheet (if crowded, use two baking sheets).
3. Bake for a total of 25 minutes, or until golden brown and tender, flipping once at the halfway point to
ensure even cooking.
4. While baking, prepare dipping sauce by whisking together cashew butter, mustard, maple syrup, salt and
pepper. Thin with almond milk (or water) until pourable.
5. Serve sweet potato wedges with no honey mustard dipping sauce! Best when fresh, though leftovers keep
in the fridge, covered, for up to a few days. Reheat in the oven.
