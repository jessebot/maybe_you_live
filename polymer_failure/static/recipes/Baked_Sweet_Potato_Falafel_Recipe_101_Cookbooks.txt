Baked Sweet Potato Falafel Recipe
These falafel are Leon's most popular veggie dish to date. They knew they wanted
falafel on the menu, but chose not to have deep fryers. After some experimenting,
this sweet potato and chickpea flour version was developed.
2 medium sweet potatoes (orange inside), around 700g or 1 1/2
pounds in total
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 small cloves of garlic, chopped
1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander
2 big handfuls of fresh cilantro/coriander, chopped
Juice of half a lemon
a scant cup (120g) gram /chickpea flour
a splash of olive oil
a sprinkling of sesame seeds
salt and pepper
Preheat the oven to 425F degrees (220C) and roast the sweet potatoes whole until
just tender - 45 minutes to 1 hour. Turn off the oven, leave the potatoes to cool, then
peel.
Put the sweet potatoes, cumin, garlic, ground and fresh coriander, lemon juice and
gram/chickpea flour into a large bowl. Season well, and mash until smooth with no
large chunks. Stick in the fridge to firm up for an hour, or the freezer for 20-30
minutes. When you take it out, your mix should be sticky rather than really wet. You
can add a tablespoon or so more of chickpea flour if necessary (the water content of
sweet potatoes varies enormously).
Reheat the oven to 400F/200C. Using a couple of soup spoons (put a well-heaped
spoonful of mix in one spoon and use the concave side of the other to shape the
sides) or a falafel scoop if you have one, make the mixture into falafelly looking
things and put them on an oiled tray. Sprinkle sesame seeds on top and bake in the
oven for around 15 minutes, until the bases are golden brown.
Makes about 18 falafel, enough for 4 - 6.
