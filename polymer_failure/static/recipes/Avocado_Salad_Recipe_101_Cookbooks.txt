Avocado Salad
I used lentilles du Puy here, but any lentils that hold their shape will work ­
Umbrian lentils or black lentils would be good alternatives.
2 teaspoons fresh oregano
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
2 cups cooked lentils
1-2 ripe avocados, quartered
1/4 cup toasted hazelnuts, chopped
1/4 cup minced chives
Smash the oregano and salt into a paste in a mortar and pestle. Gradually work in
the olive oil, and then the lemon juice.
Toss the lentils with 2 tablespoons of the oregano oil, taste, and season if needed.
Arrange on a platter or in a bowl. Just before serving, cut the avocado into quarters,
then slice quite thinly, and arrange on top of the lentils. Drizzle with a bit more of
the oil, and sprinkle with the hazelnuts, and chives. A final drizzle of oil might be
needed, and perhaps a bit more lemon juice. Enjoy!
Serves 4.
