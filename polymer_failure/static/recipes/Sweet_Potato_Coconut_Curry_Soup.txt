Recipe type: Soup
Cuisine: Vegan
Serves: 4

Ingredients
{Soup}
1 medium white onion, diced
4 cloves garlic minced
1 large sweet potato, cubed
2 Tbsp yellow curry powder
1/4 tsp chipotle (or cayenne) powder*
3/4 tsp sea salt + 1/2 tsp pepper
3 cups coconut milk (either light coconut milk or plain coconut beverage)
chickpeas
{Spicy baked chickpeas}
1 can chickpeas (2 cups)
3 Tbsp olive oil
1/2 tsp yellow curry powder
1/4 tsp sea salt
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp ginger powder
pinch chipotle (or cayenne) powder

Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 400 (for chickpeas).
2. Then start the soup by sweating the onions in a large pot over medium heat in 1/2 Tbsp coconut (or
olive/canola) oil. Cook for a few minutes and then add garlic and stir.
3. Season with 1/4 tsp each salt and pepper and stir. Add sweet potatoes, curry powder, chipotle (or
cayenne) and stir.
4. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently.

5. Add 1/4 tsp more salt and pepper, coconut milk and cover.
6. Bring to a simmer and then reduce heat to low. Simmer for 25 minutes more.
7. In the meantime, prep your chickpeas by tossing them in olive oil and spices and spreading evenly on a
baking sheet. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until crispy on the outside and slightly soft on the inside. Remove
and set aside for serving.
8. At the end of 25 minutes, taste and adjust seasonings as needed. I added about 1/4 tsp more salt and a
pinch more chipotle. Then puree using an immersion blender, food processor or blender. Transfer back to
the pot if needed and keep heat on low until ready to serve.
9. Will keep in the fridge for several days and the freezer for a month or so.
