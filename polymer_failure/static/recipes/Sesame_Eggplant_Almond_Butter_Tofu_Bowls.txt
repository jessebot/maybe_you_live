Sesame Eggplant & Almond Butter Tofu Bowls

2. If serving with traditional rice, start now by adding 3/4 cup (150 g) white or brown rice and 1 1/3 cups
(320 ml) water to a small saucepan and bringing to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to low, cover with a
secure lid, and cook for 20-25 minutes. Set aside.
3. Prepare the tofu sauce in a medium mixing bowl by whisking together sesame oil, almond butter, tamari,
lime juice, maple syrup, and 1 crushed chili (or chili garlic sauce). Taste and adjust seasonings as needed,
adding more tamari for saltiness, lime juice for acidity, chili pepper for heat, or maple syrup for
sweetness. Set aside.
4. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and cut pressed tofu into small rectangles. Toss in 3-4 Tbsp
cornstarch (they should be well coated) and sauté in 2 Tbsp sesame oil, flipping once browned on the
underside to ensure even browning – about 5 minutes total.
5. Add the almond butter sauce (see photo) and stir to combine. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, stirring
gently to ensure even cooking on all sides. Remove from pan and set aside.
6. To the still hot pan - over medium-high heat - add 1 Tbsp sesame oil and once hot, the eggplant. Drizzle
with tamari, maple syrup and sesame seeds (optional) and sauté, stirring frequently for 2-3 minutes or
until browned on all sides.
7. To assemble, divide rice between serving bowls (2-3) and top with eggplant, tofu and other desired
toppings, such as fresh vegetables, Asian pickles, Kimchi, or chili garlic sauce. Best when fresh.
