Spinach Balls
Ingredients
2 (10 oz.) packages frozen spinach, thawed & well-drained
2 small onions, very ﬁnely chopped (I use a food processor)
2 1/4 c. stufﬁng with herbs (I use Pepperidge Farm)
6 eggs, beaten
1/2 c. butter, melted
1/2 c. Parmesan cheese
2 tsp. garlic salt
1 tsp. black pepper

Directions
1.  Mix all ingredients until well combined.  Form into about 1" balls; place on a baking sheet sprayed with
cooking spray.  
2.  Bake at 350 for 20 minutes.  Makes approximately 60 balls.
NOTES:
Spinach balls may be frozen, either baked or unbaked.  (I always freeze mine pre-baked.)
For pre-baked balls:  Remove from freezer about 30 minutes prior to reheating.  Reheat in a 350 degree oven for
about 10 minutes.
For unbaked balls:  Remove from freezer 30 minutes before cooking.  Bake as directed (350 for 20 minutes).
Enjoy!
